# Fun With GPT-3

## Front End Shopify Developer Intern Challenge

### Fun with GPT-3

GPT-3 is a powerful AI model created by OpenAI. It can process plain text prompts and produce outputs that are hard to distinguish from human writing. Check out some examples of what it can do! GPT-3 can be accessed through a public API that includes a generous amount of free credits. 

### The Challenge
You will write an app that sends plain text prompts to the OpenAI API and displays the results in a list.
